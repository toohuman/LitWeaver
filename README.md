# LitWeaver
Your AI Research Assistant for Literature Reviews

LitWeaver is an AI-powered agent designed to assist researchers, students, and academics in the often daunting process of crafting comprehensive literature reviews. It aims to streamline the workflow from initial paper discovery to structured section outlining, applicable across any research domain.

## Current Aims

LitWeaver is being developed with the following core capabilities in mind:

- **Theme-Driven Synthesis**: Go beyond simple paper summarisation. LitWeaver aims to help structure and outline literature reviews based on a user-defined research theme, identifying connections and organising information logically.
- **Seed & Expand Paper Collection**: Start with an initial list of relevant paper titles provided by the user. LitWeaver will then be able to intelligently search for and suggest additional relevant papers to expand the literature base.
- **arXiv Integration**: Directly fetch paper details and potentially download PDFs from the arXiv repository, simplifying access to crucial research articles.
- **Structured Outline Generation**: Assist in organising the collected and analysed papers into coherent subsections and paragraphs suitable for typical "Background" or "Related Works" sections of academic papers or theses.
- **Domain Agnostic**: Designed to be flexible and adaptable, LitWeaver aims to assist with literature reviews on any research topic, not limited to a specific field.

LitWeaver leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and typical 'agentic' workflows to achieve these goals, providing a powerful assistant for navigating and synthesising academic literature.
